# python security

Instruction ID: rule/python/security.

## Codex adapter

Follow the wrapper and target AGENTS.md policies first. Interpret Claude/ECC tool and agent names through the currently available native Codex tools; use the configured Windows shell when a procedure says Bash. Slash-command references identify the corresponding harness-workflow skill. Inherit the operator's model choices; Claude model names do not select a Codex model. Never fabricate unavailable tools, reviewers or completion evidence. External actions still require task authorization.
